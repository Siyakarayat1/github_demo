Task 1 – Functionality of Basic Mathematical Operations Program
Functionality:
This program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user.The program first asks the user to enter two numeric values using the input() function.These values are converted into numbers using float() so the program can accept both integers and decimal values.
The program then performs four arithmetic operations:
Addition → adds the two numbers
Subtraction → subtracts the second number from the first
Multiplication → multiplies the two numbers
Division → divides the first number by the second number
A safety check is used before division to avoid division by zero error.
Finally, the results of all operations are displayed on the screen using formatted output.
Overall purpose:
The program demonstrates the use of user input, arithmetic operators, conditional statements, and output formatting in Python. 

Task 2 – Functionality of Personalized Greeting Program
Functionality:
This program creates a personalised greeting message for the user.The program asks the user to enter their first name and last name using the input() function.It combines (concatenates) both names to form the full name using string concatenation.A greeting message is then created using the full name.The final personalised greeting is displayed on the screen.
Overall purpose:
The program demonstrates the use of string input, string concatenation, and formatted output in Python to interact with the user.
